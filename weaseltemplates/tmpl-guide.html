            <p>
                Ermine is built on Weasel (Web Enable AI Support Expression Learner), an experiment
                by CSPS Digital Academy on what is possible with disruptive technology and agile practices. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Ermine is an early example of Web 3.0 thinking. Aggregation. Execution. Intention understanding. The goal is to get to what you wanted anyway just quicker. It doesn't do any of the work itself, but
                rather acts as a routing layer on top of many other services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ermine learns when you search. Each time we submit a query the AI model is given training data to make its predications on intent and content better. In order for it to learn something new we just need to ask it. It will get it wrong until out of the blue, it learns and does what you want. This is a tool that will grow with us. Support the public service in being more efficient and open. Enable citizens to be more engaged with their government and the actions of democracy. This is a tool to help lay a few foundations for a fully digital government.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ermine isn't monolithic. It's a small ~3000 line python flask application. We built it in less than 7 days to the point it could search find and act on common requests. If we can accomplish this much in 7 days with only two public servants chipping away at code, imagine what we can accomplish all together. The future of government is positively collaborative, and will be supported by a wide ecosystem of intelligent agents, like Ermine.

            <p>
                Ermine understands natural language, but along the way it does a few things to help us get the results we want. You can help by adjusting your speech patterns a bit. "Hi weasel I would like you to find for me the current sitting prime minister of our country" is probably not going to get you what you want. It also takes forever to say. You could easily try instead "contact justin trudeau" for their details (but you'd need to know who was PM). So you can also try "search lucky canada.ca who is the prime minister" and you'll get the PMs page.

            <p class="h5">Limitations / Bugs</p>
            <p>
                Limitations and Known Bugs. Ermine is an experimental alpha. We built it because we could. We built it because we wanted to get better at Python, ML, AI, cloud, and a bunch of others tools we need to make sure we can be the best at our roles of supporting the Canada School of Public Service. Reading a book on it isn't enough. You have to do it to really learn. And we've learned a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bilingual - Ermine WILL be able to understand and serve content in both official languages. We've proven it works with a poc. To make it real we need to figure out which cloud provider API is right for us. Once that happens, we'll be able to easily translate even content we don't have officially languified. We can also try to create two AI models, one which recognizes each language, but routes the requests identically (just languified). Teaching our AI system is what will make Ermine actually helpful.

                Voice Capture - This feature works in chrome on android, and chrome on desktop. It's supported everywhere yet. But Ermine happily falls back on standard search text. This can be resolved by making Ermine a hybrid-native app or a fully native android/ios app.
            </p>
            <p>
                Voice Synthesis - This feature has better support so many browsers will actually speak back to you as the answer dictates. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall Intelligence - This is a problem that will resolve itself with time and training data. The more we use it the better it is. On day one it barely understood anything. On day 7 it's reliably serving the common queries we've been feeding it. Even with data we haven't supplied it. It's inferring their types based on previous experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quality of answers - The first Ermine knowledge base was manually curated as a test. The actual data set will be a mix of community suggestions, authoritative content from the public service, and core messages built in to handle the unknown. However, it's important to note, adding new functionality and answer capacity is trivial with the current design.

                Here are some example searches you can try out in Ermine. If there's an action associated with the search, it will get done (like if you said "access canada.ca" you would be redirected). If you asked "why is open source important to my boss", weasel would give you an answer
